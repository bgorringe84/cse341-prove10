1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

	https://github.com/jo3l17/CSE341

2. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 

	the http object is ccreating the node server in port 3000,
	the prove01-routes.js file is handling the three routes
	and returning the request handler, I'm using the file system
	object to read a json file with an array of users, and adding
	the new username handling the data sended by the form.

3. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

	All is working correctly.There could be errors if there is no users.json file.

4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

	I have learned how to save data locally, usually I use localstorage,
	but nodejs don't have localstorage without a third-party module, so
	I decided to read and write a json file.

5. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?

	I would handle the error, that if there is no users.json file, I would create one

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

	5

7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

	I have used file system before, but I never thought that I could use it
	on this way, I decided to use 2 asynchronous functions, to get the data,
	even when this could have a delay to the user if it's a larger file, but
	I know that this method is better than use synchronous functions.
